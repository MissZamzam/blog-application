            <p className="paragraph">Spoken word, poetry, prose, and creative writing are all ways to express yourself and what you’re experiencing. Writing down and performing your thoughts can serve to transform the intangibility of your emotions and experiences into something more. They serve as a way for you to make your feelings tangible and real.</p>
